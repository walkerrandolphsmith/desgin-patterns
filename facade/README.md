#Facade 

The facade pattern enables a consumer to interact with multple, independent subsystems with single, common interface.
This patterns allows for the decomposition of the various subsystems while allowing the collaboration with them to be simple.
Without the facade managing the subsystems and the depedency graph they form could become cumbersome.
