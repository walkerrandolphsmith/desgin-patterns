# State / DFA / Deterministic Finite Automata

Decompose a problem into a collection of states and transition from one state to another. This ogranization forms a directed graph that affords a design that is side effect free. Given a state and transition the next state is predetermined. There is a classic problem that I will solve using the state pattern:

"Given a binary string determine if it is divisible by 3"
